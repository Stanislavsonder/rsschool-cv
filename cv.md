## About Me
**Hi, my name is Stanislav, I’am 24, and my story began on May 7, 1997.**

I have been creating websites, games, scripts, programs, mods, logos and many other things since childhood. It’s exciting, when you are able to come up with something special and bring it to life. Especially with the help of your skills. That's why I'm here. To increase knowledge, create and invent something new. It's inspiring me, because I’m not alone.
